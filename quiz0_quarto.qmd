## Question #1

Scores on the SAT Mathematics test are believed to be Normally distributed. The scores of a simple random sample of five students who recently took the exam are 550, 620, 710, 520, and 480. What is a 95% confidence interval for \$\\mu\$, the population mean score on the SAT Math test? at the end of the freshman year (Y) can be predicted from the ACT test score (X). (30 points)

\# Solution: Answer is \_.

Step 1.- Understand your data. It is a random sample of 5 students (n=5), and it is believed that the population of SAT Mathematics SAT scores is Normally distributed (given the small sample size you may use the Student's t distribution, right?).

Step 2.- What is the ask? One needs to build a 95% confidence interval (n=5, degrees of freedom=4 because you need to estimate the variance, two side test, so you need to split alpha=5% in 2).

Step 3.- What is the formula?

$$
\$\$\text{Lower Confidence Limit (95\% CI)} = \bar{x} - t_{\alpha, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$ $$
\text{Upper Confidence Limit (95\% CI)} = \bar{x} - t_{\alpha, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

What does it mean: The $\bar{x}$ bar is the simple arithmetical average of your sample data (576).

The s is your estimated standard deviation of the sample data (90.71935).

For a two-sided test, 95% confidence and 4 degrees of freedom, the $t_{\alpha,n-1}$ is 2.776445 (one can use a t-Table <https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf>)

The size of the sample is n=5 and n-1=4 and $\alpha$=5%/2

Step 4.- Carefully input the values in the formula.

Lower Bound (don't forget to round to 2 digits)

576 - 2.776445\*(90.71935)/(5)\^(1/2) = 463.36

Upper Bound (don't forget to round to 2 digits)

576 + 2.776445\*(90.71935)/(5)\^(1/2) = 688.64

Alternatively, use R-Code below

```{r}
x<-c(480, 520, 550, 620, 710)

mu <- mean(x)

s <- sqrt(var(x))

n <- length(x)

a <-qt((1-0.05/2),n-1)

a

margin.error <- abs(qt((1-0.05/2),n-1))*(s/sqrt(n)) 

t=qt((1-0.05/2),n-1)

left <- format(round(mu-margin.error,2),nsmall=2)

right <- format(round(mu+margin.error,2),nsmall=2)

cbind(left,right)
```

## Question #2

A simple random sample of 100 postal employees is used to test if the average time postal employees have worked for the postal service has changed from the value of 7.5 years recorded 20 years ago. The sample mean was 7 years with a standard deviation of 2 years. Assume the distribution of the time the employees have worked for the postal service is approximately Normal. The hypotheses being tested are $$H_0: \mu$$ = 7.5 versus $$H_a: \mu \ne$$ 7.5 A one-sample t-test will be used. What is the `p-value` for the one-sample t-test?

\# Solution: The answer is 0.0140626. Refer to the code below.

```{r}
xbar<- 7

s <- 2

n <- 100

mu <- 7.5

tstat <- (xbar-mu)/(s/sqrt(n))

2*pt(-abs(tstat),n-1)
```

## Question #3

A simple random sample of 100 postal employees is used to test if the average time postal employees have worked for the postal service has changed from the value of 7.5 years recorded 20 years ago. The sample mean was 7 years with a standard deviation of s = 2 years. Assume the distribution of the time the employees have worked for the postal service is approximately Normal. The hypotheses being tested are $$H_0: \mu = 7.5$$ versus $$H_a: \mu \ne 7.5$$ A one-sample t-test will be used. Suppose the mean and standard deviation obtained were based on a sample of size n = 25 postal workers rather than 100. What do we know about the value of the `p-value`?

\# Solution: The answer is p-value is larger, here, see the code below.

```{r}
xbar <- 7
s <- 2
n <- 25
mu <- 7.5
tstat <- (xbar-mu)/(s/sqrt(n))
2*pt(-abs(tstat),n-1)
```

## Question #4

Twelve runners are asked to run a 10-kilometer race on each of 2 consecutive weeks. In one of the races, the runners wear one brand of shoe, and in the other, a different brand. The brand of shoe they wear in each race is determined at random. All runners are timed and are asked to run their best in each race. The results (in minutes) are given below. Use the sign test for matched pairs to determine if there is evidence that times using Brand 1 tend to be faster than times using Brand 2. What is the (approximate) value of the P-value? Solution: see below,

Step 1.- Understand your data. It is 12 trails of paired events, and the brand of shoe they wear in each event is determined at random (the key here is that your data is matched). One must use the sign test for matched pairs, also known as the sign test for dependent samples, which is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between two related or paired sets of data.

Step 2.- What is the ask? One needs to find the p-value to discern if the shoe brand matters. Specifically, if using brand 1 tends to be faster than times using brand 2. One may start here (I think it can be an excellent refresher):

<https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/more-significance-testing-videos/v/hypothesis-testing-and-p-values>

Note that you want to determine if using brand 1 tends to be faster than times using brand 2 (so it is a one-tail test!). Null Hypothesis: The true probability of success is greater than or equal to 0.5 (times using brand2 are faster or the difference between brand's times is positive). Alternative Hypothesis: The true probability of success is less than 0.5, so brand 1 is faster.

Step 3.- What is the formula?

In the sign test, you focus on the signs of the differences between the paired observations. For each pair, you calculate the sign of the difference (e.g., positive if the first observation is greater, negative if the second observation is greater, and zero if they are equal). Then, you count the number of positive signs (n+) and the number of negative signs (nâˆ’)

n+=3 and n-=9

Please note that for the sign test for matched pairs and our sample of size 12 (kind of small sample, right? Also we are not sure about the distribution), the exact binomial non-parametric test is especially useful because we are dealing with a small sample size and we are uncertain of the population distribution.

One must use the binomial distribution (Check details at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_test> ).

What is the p-value? From your R printout: Exact binomial test.

```{r}
brand1<-c(31.23,29.33,30.50,32.20,33.08,31.52,30.68,31.05,33.00,29.67,30.55,32.12)

brand2<-c(32.02,28.98,30.63,32.67,32.95,31.53,30.83,31.10,33.12,29.50,30.57,32.20)  

diff<-brand1-brand2

n<-length(brand1)

pos=sum(diff>0)

binom.test(pos,n,0.5,alternative = "less")  
```

As you can see below p-value = 0.073 (you reject the null hypothesis 0.073 \> 0.05 and conclude that brand 1 is faster).

## Question #5

Let the random variable X be the number of repair calls that an appliance repair shop may receive during an hour. The distribution of X is given below.

What is the expected number of repair calls in an hour? Solution: See below

```{r}
x<-c(0,1,2,3,4)  # number of calls per hour

p<-c(0.2,0.3,0.12,0.18,0.2) #probability of observing each number of calls

#FORMULA: Expected value = SUM pri*x ANSWER is 1.88

e<-sum(x*p)

e
```

## Question #6

A discrete random variable X has a mean of $$\mu = 15$$And a standard deviation of $$\sigma=4$$The constant value 8 is added to X to create a new variable Y, i.e., Y = X + 8.

What is the expected value of Y?

Solution: E(Y)=E(X+8)=E(X)+8=15+8=23

## Question #7

A random variable X has a mean of $$\mu=9$$ and a standard deviation of s=2. The random variable X is multiplied by the constant 3 and the constant value of 5 is added to create a new variable Y, i.e., Y = 3X+5. What is the variance of Y?

Solution: Based on the formula above, you are trying to find the variance of a random variable Y which is equal to 3X+5. You can quickly figure out the variance of X to be 4 (the square of the St.Dev, right?).

To find the variance of Y, you can use the formula Var(aX+b) = a\^2Var(X) where a and b are constants. In this case, a=3 and b=5.

So, Var(Y) = Var(3X+5) = 3\^2Var(X) = 9\*4 = 36.

Therefore, the variance of Y is 36.

## Question #8

Inference procedures for comparing the standard deviations of two Normal populations are based on what distribution?

Solution: The F distribution.

## Question #9

Suppose X is a continuous random variable taking values between 0 and 1 and having a probability distribution described by the following density curve. The probability that X takes a value between 0 and 3/4 is:

Solution:

P value is the area of the regions. P(0\<X\<3/4)=P(0\<X\<0.5)+P(0.5\<X\<3/4)= 1.5\*0.5+0.5\*(3/4-0.5)=0.875(or 7/8)

### Question #10

A researcher measures a response variable Y and explanatory variable X on each of several objects. A scatter plot of the measurements is as follows. The researcher notices that there is a distinct curved pattern in the plot. It would be appropriate to conclude.....

Solution: Use the graph attached

![Question 10 picture](images/GraphQ10.jpg)

When the scatter plot shows a lot of dispersion, and the researcher notices a curved pattern then it may not refer to linear fit. So a simple line does not apply to assessing curved or non-linear functions.
